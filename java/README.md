# Java LeetCode Solutions

This directory contains Java solutions to LeetCode problems.

## Structure

- `Practice1.java` - ~4,500 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `Practice2.java` - ~3,700 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `Practice3.java` - ~3,800 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `Practice4.java` - ~4,000 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `Practice5.java` - ~3,600 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `Practice6.java` - ~2,800 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `References.java` - Utility functions, algorithms, and reference implementations

## Organization

Each Practice file contains multiple LeetCode problems. I create a new Practice class when my IDE starts to lag, which is usually around 4,000 lines.

## Common Patterns

The `References.java` file contains useful utilities including:
- Binary search variations (exact, ceiling, floor)
- Sorting examples and comparators
- HashMap operations
- Queue/Deque examples
- Array/List conversions
- File I/O operations
- XML/JSON parsing utilities
