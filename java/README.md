# Java LeetCode Solutions

This directory contains Java solutions to LeetCode problems.

## 📊 Statistics

- **Total Solutions**: ~1,171 functions across 6 Practice files
- **Total Lines**: ~22,400 lines of Java code
- **Organization**: Solutions grouped by file creation date (not difficulty)

## 📁 Structure

- `Practice1.java` - ~4,500 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `Practice2.java` - ~3,700 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `Practice3.java` - ~3,800 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `Practice4.java` - ~4,000 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `Practice5.java` - ~3,600 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `Practice6.java` - ~2,800 lines of LeetCode solutions
- `References.java` - Utility functions, algorithms, and reference implementations

## 🔍 Finding Solutions

### Search Tips
1. **By Problem Name**: Use Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F) and search for keywords from the problem title
2. **By Data Structure**: Search for class names like `TreeNode`, `ListNode`, `Graph`
3. **By Pattern**: Search for algorithm keywords like `DFS`, `BFS`, `DP`, `binary search`

### File Organization
- Solutions are added chronologically to Practice files
- New Practice file created when current file reaches ~4,000 lines (IDE performance threshold)
- No specific difficulty ordering - problems mixed within files

## 🛠️ Common Utilities

The `References.java` file contains reusable code including:
- **Binary Search**: Exact match, ceiling search, floor search
- **Sorting**: Custom comparators and sorting examples
- **Data Structures**: HashMap operations, Queue/Deque examples
- **Conversions**: Array ↔ List, String ↔ Integer
- **I/O Operations**: File reading/writing, XML/JSON parsing

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Running Solutions
```bash
# Compile a specific Practice file
javac Practice1.java

# Run if there's a main method (rare - mostly just solution functions)
java Practice1
```

### Testing
- Most functions are standalone solutions (no main method)
- Copy function to LeetCode editor to test
- Or create your own test harness in a separate file

### Adding New Solutions
1. Add to `Practice6.java` (most recent file)
2. Include comment block with problem name and complexity
3. When file approaches 4,000 lines, create `Practice7.java`
