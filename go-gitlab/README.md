# Go Learning Materials from GitLab

This directory contains Go code migrated from the GitLab learninggo repository.

## Contents

- `src/apiTest.go` - Wikipedia API testing examples
- `src/deque_example.go` - Double-ended queue implementation examples
- `src/go.mod` - Module definition

## Status

This code is preserved as-is from the GitLab repository. Future work will involve:
- Extracting and categorizing LeetCode solutions by difficulty
- Integrating with the main `go/` directory structure
- Organizing utility code and examples
